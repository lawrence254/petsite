    <h2>My Dogs Blog.</h2>
    <p>My dogs name is husky. He's a german shephered and he is turning 5 years old this year.</p>
    <p>He is well behaved when someone is around but when he know he is all alone he gets adventurous.</p>
    <p>He likes playing with a toy bone that I bought him while he was still young, but he has grown to particulalry enjoy chewing anything he finds.</p>
    <p>I usually let him play around the compound because he gets quite energetic and likes to run around a lot. I allow him to run around but I also have to keep a very close eye on him lest he begins digging holes.</p>
